        <p><b>[Verse 1]</b>
This is my desire to honor You
Lord, with all my heart, I worship You
All I have within me, I give You praise
All that I adore is in You

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Lord, I give You my heart
I give You my soul, I live for You alone
Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
This is my desire to honor You
Lord, with all my heart, I worship You
All I have within me, I give You praise
All that I adore is in You

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Lord, I give You my heart
I give You my soul, I live for You alone
Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

<b>[Bridge]</b>
And I will live
And I will live for You
And I will live
And I will live for You
Oh and I will live
And I will live
And I will live for You

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Lord, I give You my heart
I give You my soul, I live for You alone
Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

<b>[Outro]</b>
Have Your way
