        <p><b>[Verse]</b>
I love You, Lord, and I lift my voice
To worship You, O my soul rejoice
Take joy, my King, in what You hear
May it be a sweet, sweet sound in Your ear
I love You, Lord, and I lift my voice
To worship You, O my soul rejoice
Take joy, my King, in what You hear
May it be a sweet, sweet sound in Your ear

<b>[Verse]</b>
I love You, Lord, and I lift my voice
To worship You, O my soul rejoice
Take joy, my King, in what You hear
And may it be a sweet, sweet sound in Your ear
Take joy, my King, in what You hear
May it be a sweet, sweet sound in Your ear, sweet sound
May it be a sweet, sweet sound in Your ear

<b>[Outro]</b>
O Jesus, sweet, sweet sound
