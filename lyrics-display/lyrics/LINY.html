        <p><b>[Verse 1]</b>
Lord, I come, I confess
Bowing here, I find my rest
Without You, I fall apart
You're the One that guides my heart

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are
And where You are, Lord, I am free
Holiness is Christ in me

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

<b>[Bridge]</b>
So teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
When I cannot stand, I'll fall on You
Jesus, You're my hope and stay

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

<b>[Outro]</b>
You're my one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You
