        <p><b>[Verse 1]</b>
As the deer pants for the water
So my soul longs after You
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You

<b>[Refrain]</b>
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
I want You more than gold or silver
Only You can satisfy
You alone are the real joy giver
And the apple of my eye

<b>[Refrain]</b>
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You

<b>[Verse 3]</b>
You're my friend and You're my brother
Even though you are a King
I love You more than any other
So much more than anything

<b>[Refrain]</b>
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You
