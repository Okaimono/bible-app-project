        <p><b>[Verse 1]</b>
To God be the glory, great things He has done
He so loved the world that He gave us His son
Who gave up His life, the forgiveness of sin
The gates open wide, He has welcomed us in

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Oh, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice
Oh, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice
Oh, come to the Father through Jesus His son
And give Him thе glory, great things He has done

<b>[Post-Chorus]</b>
Praisе the Lord (Praise the Lord)
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord)
To God be the glory

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood
To every believer the promise of God
The vilest offender who truly believes
That moment from Jesus, a pardon receives

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Oh, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice
Oh, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice
Oh, come to the Father through Jesus His son
And give Him the glory, great things He has done

<b>[Post-Chorus]</b>
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord)
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord)
To God be the glory
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord)
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord)
To God be the glory

<b>[Bridge]</b>
Great things He has taught us, great things He has done
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the son
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
Oh, to God be the glory

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Oh, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice
Oh, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice
Oh, come to the Father through Jesus His son
And give Him the glory, great things He has done
Oh, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice
Oh, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice
Oh, come to the Father through Jesus His son
And give Him the glory, great things He has done


<b>[Post-Chorus]</b>
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord)
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord)
To God be the glory
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord)
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord)
Oh, to God be the glory
Praise the Lord
