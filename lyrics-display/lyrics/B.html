        <p><b>[Verse]</b>
This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your holy presence living in me
This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
Your very word spoken to me

<b>[Chorus]</b>
And I... I... I-I-I, I'm desperate for You
And I... I... I-I-I, I'm lost without You

<b>[Verse]</b>
This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your holy presence living in me
This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
Your very word spoken to me

<b>[Chorus]</b>
And I... I... I-I-I, I'm desperate for You
And I... I... I-I-I, I'm lost without You
And I... I... I-I-I, I'm desperate for You
And I... I... I-I-I, I'm lost without You

<b>[Post-Chorus]</b>
I'm lost without You
I'm lost without You
I'm desperate for You
I'm desperate for You...
I'm lost without You (I'm desperate for You)
I'm lost without You now
I'm desperate for You
I'm desperate for You...
I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost without You, Lord
I'm lost without You
I'm lost without You (I'm desperate for You)
I'm lost without You
I'm desperate for You

<b>[Outro]</b>
How many of you are hungry for God?
Are you hungry for Him?
