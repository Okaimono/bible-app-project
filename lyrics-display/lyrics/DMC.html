        <p><b>[Verse]</b>
Draw me close to You
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear You say that I'm Your friend
You are my desire
No one else will do
'Cause nothing else can take Your place
To feel the warmth of Your embrace
Help me find the way
Bring me back to You

<b>[Chorus]</b>
You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know You are near

<b>[Verse]</b>
Draw me close to You
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear You say that I'm Your friend
You are my desire
No one else will do
'Cause nothing else can take Your place
To feel the warmth of Your embrace
Help me find the way
Bring me back to You

<b>[Chorus]</b>
You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know You are near
You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know You are near

<b>[Outro]</b>
Help me know You are near
Help me know You are near
