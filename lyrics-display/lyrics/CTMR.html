        <p><b>[Intro]</b>
I called and You came
I called and You came
I called and You came

<b>[Chorus]</b>
I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I, I wanna be where You are
Oh, I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I, I wanna be where You are
I wanna be there
I wanna be there

<b>[Verse 1]</b>
Falling on my knees in worship
Giving all I am to seek Your face
Lord, all I am is Yours

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
My whole life I place in Your hands
God of Mercy, humbled I bow down
In Your presence, at Your throne

<b>[Chorus]</b>
For I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I, I wanna be where You are
I called
For I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I, I wanna be where You are

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
My whole life I place in Your hands
God of Mercy, humbled I bow down
In Your presence, at Your throne
My whole life I place in Your hands
God of Mercy, humbled I bow down
In Your presence, at Your throne

<b>[Chorus]</b>
For I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I, I wanna be where You are
I wanna be there
For I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I, I wanna be where You are

<b>[Spontaneous 1]</b>
Stay here
I wanna be where You are
I wanna be there, I wanna be there
Like it was the first time
I wanna be there

<b>[Bridge]</b>
In my life, be lifted high
In our world, be lifted high
In our love, be lifted high, oh-ohh
In my life, be lifted high
In our world, be lifted high
In our love, be lifted high
Be lifted high, higher, oh-ohh
In my life, be lifted high
In our world, be lifted high
In our love, be lifted high, oh-ohh-ohhh
In my life, be lifted high
In our world, be lifted high
In our love, be lifted (high)
Higher, higher, oh-ohh-ohhh
In my life, be lifted high
In our world, oh, be lifted high
In our love, be lifted high
One more time, let's sing it out, be lifted
In my life, be lifted high
In our world, be lifted high
In our love, be lifted high, yeah


<b>[Post-Bridge]</b>
Be lifted up
Be lifted up
Be glorified
Be lifted up

<b>[Spontaneous 2]</b>
’Cause we're coming back, to our first love
We're coming back, to our first love
We’re coming back, to our first love
I remember, when You rescued me
So I'm coming back, to my first love

<b>[Chorus]</b>
'Cause I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I, I wanna be where You are
Oh, I called, (You answered) You'll always answer
And You (came) come to my rescue
And I, (I) just wanna be where You are
