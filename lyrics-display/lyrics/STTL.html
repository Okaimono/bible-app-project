        <p><b>[Verse 1]</b>
My Jesus, my Savior
Lord, there is none like You
All of my days, I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Shout to the Lord
All the earth, let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King
(Mountains bow down) Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of Your name
I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You

<b>[Verse 1]</b>
My Jesus, (My Savior) my Savior
Lord, there is none like You (Ohh, there is nothing like You)
And all of my days, I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
(You're my comfort) My comfort
(Yeah, my shelter, yes) My shelter
(You're my tower) Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, and all that I am
Never cease to worship You

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Shout to the Lord
All the earth, let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of Your name
I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have in
Oh, shout to the Lord
All the earth, let us sing, yeah
Power and majesty, praise to the King
(Mountains bow down) Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of Your name (Wonderful name)
I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have in (You)

<b>[Outro]</b>
Nothing compares to the promise I have in
Ooh, nothing compares to the promise I have in You
