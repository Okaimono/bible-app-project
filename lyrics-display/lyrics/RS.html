        <p><b>[Verse 1]</b>
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Holy, holy is He
Sing a new song to Him who sits on
Heaven's mercy seat
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Holy, holy is He
We sing a new song to Him who sits on
Heaven's mercy seat

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come
With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings
You are my everything and I will adore You

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
Clothed in rainbows of living color
Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be
To You the only wise King

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come
With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings
You are my everything and I will adore You (I will adore You, oh)

<b>[Bridge]</b>
Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
At the mention of Your Name
Jesus, Your Name is power, breath and living water
Such a marvelous mystery, oh
You're worthy, mystery
You are worthy

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come
With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings
You are my everything and I will adore You

<b>[Outro]</b>
I will adore You
