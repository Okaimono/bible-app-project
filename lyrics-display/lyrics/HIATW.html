        <p><b>[Verse 1]</b>
Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes and let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
Altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
King of all days, oh so highly exalted
You're glorious in heaven above, yes You are
Humbly You came to this Earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
Altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

<b>[Verse 3]</b>
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin up on that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin up on that cross

<b>[Bridge]</b>
Here I am, here I am to worship You
Here I am to worship You
Help me sing

Here I am to worship You
Here I am to worship You
Here I am, here I am

<b>[Chorus]</b>
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
Altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
Altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

<b>[Outro]</b>
Wonderful to me, You're wonderful to me
You're lovely and You are worthy
Say, say wonderful, wonderful

Here I am to worship
Here I am to worship
Here I am to worship
Here I am to worship
