        <p><b>[Verse 1]</b>
A thousand generations falling down in worship
To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
And all who've gone before us, and all who will believe
Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb

<b>[Pre-Chorus]</b>
Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all

<b>[Chorus]</b>
And the angels cry, "Holy"
All Creation cries, "Holy"
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
If you've been forgiven, if you've been redeemed
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
If you walk in freedom, if you bear His name
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
We'll sing the song forever and amen

<b>[Chorus]</b>
And the angels cry, "Holy"
All Creation cries, "Holy"
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever
Hear Your people sing, "Holy"
To the King of kings, holy
You will always be holy
Holy forever

<b>[Pre-Chorus]</b>
Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominion
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all, Jesus
Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all (Oh, stands above)
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all

<b>[Chorus]</b>
And the angels cry, "Holy"
All Creation cries, "Holy"
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever (We cry, "Holy forever")
Hear Your people sing, "Holy" (We will sing)
To the King of kings, (Holy) holy (Holy forever)
You will always be holy
Holy forever

<b>[Outro]</b>
You will always be holy
Holy forever
