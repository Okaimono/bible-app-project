        <b>Verse 1</b>
        I love You, Lord
        For Your mercy never fails me
        All my days, I've been held in Your hands
        From the moment that I wake up
        Until I lay my head
        Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

        <b>Chorus</b>
        'Cause all my life You have been faithful
        And all my life You have been so, so good
        With every breath that I am able
        Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

        <b>Verse 2</b>
        I love Your voice
        You have led me through the fire
        In darkest night
        You are close like no other
        I've known You as a Father
        I've known You as a Friend
        And I have lived in the goodness of God

        <b>Chorus (x2)</b>
        'Cause all my life You have been faithful
        And all my life You have been so, so good
        With every breath that I am able
        Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

        <b>Bridge (x2)</b>
        Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
        Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
        With my life laid down, I surrendered now
        I give You everything
        Your goodness is running after, it's running after me

        <b>Chrous (x2)</b>
        And all my life You have been faithful
        And all my life You have been so, so good
        With every breath that I am able
        Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
        I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
