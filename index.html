            <p>Our Father in heaven, to You belongs all the glory. 
Thank you Jesus for everything you have provided for. 
Thank you Father for the family that You have given us.

We give this website to You Father.
We pray that This website will be anointed by your Spirit.
We pray that this website will serve to glorify You alone.
We pray that your Spirit will breathe life into this website.
    
We love you forever Jesus!
